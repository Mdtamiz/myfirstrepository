First repository
Imagine you’re writing a notebook (your project code).

Every time you make changes, instead of erasing, you take a photocopy of the page and keep it safe.
👉 That’s what Git does — it keeps versions of your work, so you can go back if you mess up.

Now, you and your friends want to work on the same notebook from different places.

You keep the master notebook in a library where everyone can access it.
👉 That’s GitHub — an online library (cloud) where your Git-controlled project is stored.

So,

Git = Your personal time machine + photocopy machine for code.

GitHub = The library where you and your team safely share and collaborate on those copies.

⚡ One-line memory trick:
👉 “Git saves versions, GitHub shares them with the world.”
Step 1: Create GitHub Account

Go to 👉 https://github.com
.

Click Sign up (top right).

Enter:

Email address

Password

Username (your GitHub name – unique, like your identity)

Verify the puzzle (GitHub bot check).

Confirm your email (you’ll get a verification link). ✅

Now you have your GitHub account. 🎉

🟢 Step 2: Create Your First Repository

Once logged in, click the + sign (top right corner) → New repository.

Fill details:

Repository name → e.g., my-first-repo

Add a description (optional).

Choose Public (anyone can see) or Private (only you).

Tick Initialize this repository with a README (important, so repo isn’t empty).

Click Create repository. ✅

Now you have your repo on GitHub. 🎊

🟢 Step 3: Connect with Git (on your computer)

(Assuming you have Git installed – if not, we’ll install it)

Open your terminal / command prompt:

# Clone the repo to your computer
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-first-repo.git

# Go inside the repo folder
cd my-first-repo

# Create a new file
echo "Hello GitHub!" > hello.txt

# Add the file to Git
git add hello.txt

# Commit (save the snapshot)
git commit -m "My first commit"

# Push (send changes to GitHub)
git push origin main


✅ Refresh your GitHub repo page → you’ll see hello.txt uploaded.

⚡ That’s it! You created a GitHub account, a repo, and pushed your first code. 🎉
