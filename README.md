First repository
Imagine you’re writing a notebook (your project code).

Every time you make changes, instead of erasing, you take a photocopy of the page and keep it safe.
👉 That’s what Git does — it keeps versions of your work, so you can go back if you mess up.

Now, you and your friends want to work on the same notebook from different places.

You keep the master notebook in a library where everyone can access it.
👉 That’s GitHub — an online library (cloud) where your Git-controlled project is stored.

So,

Git = Your personal time machine + photocopy machine for code.

GitHub = The library where you and your team safely share and collaborate on those copies.

⚡ One-line memory trick:
👉 “Git saves versions, GitHub shares them with the world.”
